## What is this?

IPL Auction 2026 is a fully interactive, single-player IPL auction simulator built with Next.js and TypeScript. You pick a franchise, get ₹120 Crore, and compete against 9 AI-powered rival teams to build the best squad before the gavel falls.

Every decision matters — bid too early and you blow your budget on early sets, wait too long and an AI snipes your target in the last 2 seconds. The game is designed to feel like a real auction room.

## Features

### Core Auction Engine

- **Real-time 10-second bid timer** with a live progress bar that pulses red in the final 3 seconds
- **Automatic player progression** — auction moves through all players sorted by role: Batsmen → Wicketkeepers → All-rounders → Bowlers
- **Set transition overlays** — cinematic full-screen announcements between each role group
- **Sold / Unsold resolution** — players with no bids go to the unsold pool; you can review them anytime mid-auction

### AI Bidding System (6 Strategies)

The 9 rival AI teams don't just bid randomly. Each one runs a multi-strategy decision engine on every bid:

| Strategy | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Purse-to-Slot Panic** | AI calculates average budget per remaining slot and caps spending if it's running low |
| **Position Quota Logic** | AI becomes aggressive when it's short on a role, and backs off when it already has world-class cover |
| **Price Elasticity** | Max bid limits scale with player rating — elite (95+) players trigger much higher ceilings |
| **Set Inflation Fatigue** | If 3+ players have already sold above ₹18 Cr early in the auction, AI cools down to conserve |
| **Squad Deficit Panic Mode** | In the final 35% of the auction, AI goes into emergency mode if it's short on a required role |
| **Rival Purse Bullying** | Top-3 richest AI teams inflate their ceilings when they know rivals are broke |

AI also has **last-second snipe behaviour** — a random delay window in the final 2–3 seconds simulates a real auction table.

### Live Commentary Engine

A dynamic broadcast commentary hub generates contextual lines based on what's actually happening:

- **Openers** — first bid on a player
- **Standard** — mid-auction increments
- **Escalation** — when price crosses 2.5x base
- **Snipe** — last-second bids with ≤3s on clock
- **Bullying** — when a rich AI dominates the room
- **Sold anthems** — each of the 10 franchises has 3 unique custom sold lines (e.g. *"joins the Paltan! #AalaRe 💙"* for MI)
- **Unsold** — 3 variants of commentary when no one bids

All lines are parameterised templates — `{bidder}`, `{player}`, `{bid}`, `{timer}` — filled dynamically at runtime. No repeated lines.

### Scouting & Squad Management

- **Player search sidebar** — search the full player pool by name in real time, filtered by role
- **Favourites / Target marking** — star any unsold player to get a visual highlight glow when they hit the auction block
- **Sold status tracking** — starred players show `(SOLD - ₹XCr)` inline once bought, star icon disappears
- **Squad Requirements panel** — live tracker showing Bat/Bowl/AR/WK counts vs minimums (5/4/4/2)
- **Teams overview modal** — view all 10 franchises sorted by remaining purse; drill into any team's full squad
- **Unsold players modal** — review every unsold player with their country

### UI & Design

- **Dynamic colour theming** — the entire UI shifts to your selected franchise's primary colour. Glow, borders, buttons, badges, and accents all update live
- **Franchise mottos** — each team's tagline displays on the selection screen (`#WhistlePodu`, `#EeSalaCupNamde`, etc.)
- **Franchise briefing screen** — pre-auction onboarding with strategy cards and squad requirements
- **3-2-1 countdown** — cinematic full-screen countdown before the auction opens
- **Hover watermark effect** — semi-transparent team logos appear behind franchise cards on hover
- **Sold overlay** — full-screen modal with team logo and final price on every sale
- **Responsive auction board** — three-panel layout: player pool sidebar / main auction card / user squad sidebar

## How the Auction Works

1. **Pick your franchise** — choose from all 10 IPL teams. Your starting purse is ₹120 Crore.
2. **Auction begins** — players come up in sets: Batsmen first, then Wicketkeepers, All-rounders, Bowlers.
3. **Bid or hold** — you have 10 seconds per player. Click BID to raise the price. The AI teams bid against you in real time.
4. **Build your squad** — you need at least 15 players: 5 bat, 4 bowl, 4 AR, 2 WK. Max 4 overseas players.
5. **Auction ends** — once all players are processed, the game ends. Your final squad and purse balance are shown.

**Pro tip:** The AI snipes hard in the last 2 seconds. Don't wait too long on your key targets.

## Multiplayer (In Development)

Real-time multiplayer is currently being built. Up to 10 players will be able to join a lobby, each pick a different franchise, and compete in a live shared auction room.

Planned tech: **WebSockets** (Socket.io or Supabase Realtime) for shared bid state, lobby system with room codes, and a host-controlled auction flow.

If you want to follow progress or contribute, watch the repo.
